# SELAH-IM ðŸ§˜

**Technology that breathes with you**

The first contemplative technology platform. Two chambers for consciousness to explore itself: breathing meditation and AI-synthesized contemplative questions.

## Philosophy

Selah = ×¡×œ×¢ = ×¡×œ×” (pause and rock)

What if technology could create space for **presence** instead of demanding attention? Most technology optimizes usâ€”makes us faster, more productive, more engaged. Selah inverts this entirely. It serves consciousness itself, creating space for presence, reflection, and the quiet recognition of what we already are.

## Features

- ðŸ§˜ **Meditation Chamber** - Interactive breathing orb with touch-responsive meditation
- ðŸ’­ **Contemplation Chamber** - AI-synthesized daily questions from your contemplative history  
- ðŸ“§ **Email Collection** - Gentle invitation to join the contemplative journey
- ðŸª¨ **Rock-like Design** - Grounded, balanced, breathing aesthetic

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **Vercel Postgres** (Serverless database)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first with custom design tokens)
- **TypeScript** (Type safety)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Vercel Postgres credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add Vercel Postgres database

## Open Source

This project will be open source to inspire a movement of contemplative technology. The frontend patterns and breathing interactions are gifts to the community.
